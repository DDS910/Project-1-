# Project-1-
Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning Methods (Multiple Linear Regression,
Random Forest, and Decision Tree)

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

Data explanation :

1.Age: age of the patient [years]

2.Sex: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]

3.ChestPainType: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]

4.RestingBP: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]

5.Cholesterol: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]

6.FastingBS: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]

7.RestingECG: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]

8.MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]
ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]

9.Oldpeak: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]

10.ST_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]

11.HeartDisease: output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]
